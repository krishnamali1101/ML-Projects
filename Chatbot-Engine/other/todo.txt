Just concentrate on intent(verb)
Default Bot operations: ["create", "update", "delete", "deploy"]
train bot on default boy operations (may be on synonyms)
save trained model
test bot on multiple lines
Add new bot operations dynamically
train bot on new operations
Test bot

create dict of "operation": [synonyms] of all operations
read urser input (usr_input)
filter & pos tag
extract intents [intents]
if any intent exist directly in [intents] thn call that operation
else get synonyms of all [intents]
get union of all <intents> with available operations synonyms
Apply threshold
[intent1]
	"create" : 
		- calculate cosign similarity with "create" using google_w2v model
		- calculate union of that intent synonyms & create synonyms
		- fetch combined similarity
	"update" :
		-
		-
	....

vote for final operation under some threshold value
if not able to find operation under threshold value thn ask for ask user to add new intents

	create a new bot

for existing:
create dict of {opr:[intents]}
if input line is having any intent associated with our dict operations thn return operation else check for best match using distance calculation under some % threashold else return "Didnt understand msg, can u elubrate more/add new operation"

"add new operation"
	enter operation(intent)
		enter some example sentences

operation added!

for new operation: provide intent(opr)
and few sentences

add new opr in opr dict {opr:[intents]}
process all sentence and fetch intents and add to intent ist


[
- get some sentences
- find synonyms and example lines
